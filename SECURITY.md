### Security Considerations

Meet Teams Bot handles sensitive data and operates in security-critical environments. Key security considerations include:

#### Data Handling
- Meeting recordings contain sensitive audio/video data
- Authentication tokens and API keys must be protected
- Logs may contain personally identifiable information

#### Browser Automation
- Chrome extension has access to meeting platforms
- Automated actions could be misused if compromised
- Screen recording capabilities require careful permission handling

#### Network Security
- WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- S3 uploads of sensitive recording data
- Webhook endpoints for status notifications

#### Access Control
- Bot authentication and authorization
- Meeting join permissions and validation
- Administrative controls and monitoring

### Security Best Practices

When using Meet Teams Bot:

1. **Environment Security**
   - Use secure, isolated environments for bot deployment
   - Regularly update dependencies and system packages
   - Monitor for unusual activity or unauthorized access

2. **Configuration Security**
   - Store secrets and API keys securely (environment variables, secret managers)
   - Use HTTPS for all external communications
   - Validate and sanitize all input parameters

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt recordings at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper access controls for recorded data
   - Follow data retention and deletion policies

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Monitor bot activity and system resources
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Set up alerts for suspicious behavior

### Known Security Considerations

#### Browser Extension Security
- The Chrome extension requires broad permissions to interact with meeting platforms
- Extension code is visible to users and should not contain secrets
- Regular security reviews of extension permissions and functionality

#### Recording Data Security
- Recordings contain sensitive meeting content
- Proper encryption and access controls are essential
- Consider legal and compliance requirements for data handling

#### Authentication and Authorization
- Bot tokens and API keys provide significant access
- Implement proper token rotation and revocation procedures
- Monitor for unauthorized bot usage

### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Initial report and discussion remain private
2. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with reporters to understand and fix issues
3. **Public Disclosure**: After fixes are available, we may publish security advisories
4. **Credit**: We acknowledge security researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly

### Security Updates
